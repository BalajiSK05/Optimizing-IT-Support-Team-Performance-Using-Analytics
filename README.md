# Optimizing-IT-Support-Team-Performance-Using-Analytics
Infosys Springboard internship - Data Visualization


The Project i am working on is Optimizing IT Support Team Performance Using Analytics. where i will clean , transform and analyze the performance of IT Support team. i will use power BI to visualize the data and from that i can make decisions, which can benefit the company.

In the first week of the internship , i learnt about power BI and Power Query, where i can clean and transform the data, in the second week i used python to clean the data, i chose google colab to work on this project. in the 3rd week i learnt about EDA(Exploratory data analysis). which will be very helpgul to understand the data, by understanding the data we can answer the questions of the stakeholders. currently its 4th week , and i learnt about live data connection in Power BI. In the 5th week I learnt about KPI(key performance indicator) , it is a metric used to measure the performance against the target, it is used to understand whether the tasks are achieved or not to accomplish a particular goal. in the 6th week i didnt attend the entire week class due to A big fest happened in my college which is called summit of future( one of the india's futuristic and biggest fest).  i was coordinator for datathon and workshops in that event, but after that i mailed my mentor that i didnt attend the class and asked him what he taught in that week. he told that he taught data modelling in that week, so what i did was went to youtube and searched for resources to learn data modelling and i learnt it and did data modelling on some dataset which i have added in my repo. in the 7th week i attended every class and learnt DAX (data analysis expressions), it is used to create measures and perform calculations based on the data. we can also use IF conditions in DAX to calculate the numbers in the data.

## Power BI Basics and Data Transformation

I worked with Power BI to understand how datasets are loaded from different sources and transformed using Power Query. This included basic data preparation tasks such as changing data types, removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and shaping the data for analysis. This step helped me understand the importance of preparing clean and structured data before visualization.

## Data Cleaning Using Python

Data cleaning was performed using Python in Google Colab. I used Pandas to clean datasets by handling null values, removing duplicate records, renaming columns, and correcting data formats. After cleaning, the datasets were exported as Excel or CSV files so they could be reused for analysis and visualization. This helped me understand how Python can be effectively used along with Power BI in analytics workflows.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

I learned the purpose of Exploratory Data Analysis and how it helps in understanding data patterns before building dashboards. As part of this, I performed EDA on a Netflix dataset and framed analytical questions focused on business insights. The questions were designed to understand content availability, growth trends, ratings distribution, and regional presence, with an emphasis on how these insights could benefit the company.

## Live API Data Connection

I explored how live or near real-time data can be connected to Power BI using web APIs. This involved understanding how APIs work, how JSON data is retrieved using the Web connector, and how it is transformed using Power Query. I also learned about data refresh concepts and how live data can be used for monitoring and real-time reporting scenarios.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

I learned about Key Performance Indicators and their role in measuring performance. I worked on identifying relevant KPIs, understanding how they are calculated, and visualizing them effectively in Power BI dashboards. This helped me understand how KPIs support quick decision-making and performance tracking.

## Data Modeling

Data modeling concepts were covered to understand how multiple tables can be connected in Power BI. I learned about relationships, cardinality, and filter direction, and how proper data modeling impacts report accuracy and performance. This step helped me understand how backend structure supports meaningful analytics.

## DAX Functions

I started working with DAX functions to create calculated columns and measures in Power BI. This included basic DAX concepts used for aggregations, calculations, and dynamic analysis. Learning DAX helped me understand how logic can be applied within reports to derive deeper insights from data.
